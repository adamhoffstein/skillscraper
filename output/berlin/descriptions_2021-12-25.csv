The Observability team is in charge of developing solutions that focus on application developers and engineers that run infrastructure and services supporting these applications. Elasticsearch is an efficient datastore for logs, metrics, and application traces, supporting the three pillars of observability. The Observability team builds and maintains solutions that make getting insights from this data turnkey and efficient, such as our APM, Infrastructure Monitoring, and Logs solutions. When developing these solutions, we think about the problem end-to-end: how do we automatically collect data from common data sources, how do we store it efficiently in Elasticsearch, how do we present this information to the user, what actions do we take on the insights from the data? All of these aspects are important in bringing a turnkey solution to the market. As a Senior Go Engineer, APM , you will be part of a team developing high quality, open and free APM products that are part of the ingest flow of the Elastic APM solution. You will be mainly working on the APM Server, which is a stateless component that receives data from APM agents and validates and transforms them into Elasticsearch documents. It controls the amount of data flowing into Elasticsearch and can buffer data temporarily without adding overhead to the APM agents. The APM Server also acts as middleware for several use cases, such as applying source mapping for JavaScript in the browser. As part of the Go APM team, you\xe2\x80\x99ll be deeply involved with the APM Server codebase, take on responsibilities for new features, have a focus on performant data modeling in Elasticsearch and ensure constant benchmarking of the product. You will also contribute to the APM Go agent, and engage with the open source community. You will work closely with the rest of the team, with the APM agents team when adding new features to the server API, with the Elasticsearch and the APM UI team when optimizing data models for storage and query performance, and with many more, such as the Integrations and the Cloud team. The team is diverse and distributed across the world, and collaborates on a daily basis over GitHub, Zoom, and Slack. What you will be doing: Design data formats for optimized data storage and query performance in Elasticsearch, working closely with the Elasticsearch and the APM UI team. Work on profiling and sampling of high volume data. Build new features for the Elastic APM Server and the APM Go agent. Work together with the Cloud team for ensuring a seamless user experience for APM Server on Elastic Cloud. Work with the support team on customer requests. Engage with the community via pull requests, issues and discuss forums. What you bring along: Extensive knowledge and experience with data modeling and processing. Knowledge of distributed systems and databases, ideally of Elasticsearch. Experience with sampling and analysing high volume data. Experience with and interest in going deep on advanced topics such as memory management, benchmarking and profiling. Professional and in-depth experience with Go with strong analytical, debugging, and troubleshooting skills. Deep understanding of the observability space.

"Company Description Our mission is to enable people to trust each other at scale. Social media has changed our society more deeply than most people realize. For most of our history, we formed communities around shared locations, but this has been changing rapidly with technologies such as the internet and \xe2\x80\x93 especially \xe2\x80\x93 social media. Today we are forming communities around shared ideas more than ever. This is a structural change, so it affects every aspect of society. Including our model of trust. Who we trust has always been determined by communities, but online communities are larger and they create more information. Our brains are not able to handle this scale . This is why the world suddenly feels like it is getting torn apart. We need to find a new model of trust. It is not only about fixing what is broken. It is also an opportunity to create a more innovative society with faster scientific progress and equal access to opportunity. We intend to do that by indexing the social graph of humanity and making it available to build on to anyone . We started by indexing Twitter, but soon will also index podcasts, research papers, other social media platforms (e.g. Reddit, Github) etc., and combine them together. This is possible because we invented a community search algorithm that can accurately map communities from a single word input , such as \'bitcoin\', \'vegan\' or \'tennis\'. This approach works on existing social graphs. Tasks Job Description Your job is going to be to build models that enable capturing social dynamics and expressing them as precise metrics. You can see an example of such metrics on hive .one where we published the first results of our work. This is a real research role. You will be given problems to work on that nobody has solved before. You can also find interesting problems and propose to work on them as long as they fit within the larger scope of research and business goals of the organization. You will have freedom in choosing how to approach solving problems you are working on and which technologies to use. You can use any technology you wish as long as you think this is the best approach to solving the problem at hand. People who waste time playing around with fancy new technology that is unnecessary to solve the problem get fired quickly. If you are the kind of person we are looking for you will appreciate being in an environment focused on getting things done. We are currently still working on figuring out how to index all of Twitter and there are plenty of hard problems to solve here. However, we are already starting to look into indexing other graphs \xe2\x80\x93 such as podcasts, Github, Reddit, Behance or OpenSea and NFTs in general. We will be building small, multi-disciplinary teams around each one of these. You can either contribute to the Twitter effort or work on one of the others. Responsibilities Envision, implement, and validate algorithms that aggregate complex, graphical data into comprehensible descriptions of social networks. Planning and coordination of data modeling & acquisition strategy, feature releases. Close cooperation with the product team in translating planned product features into algorithms/metrics and vice versa. Close cooperation with the development team in shaping our IT strategy and ensuring the robustness of production algorithms. As a DS evangelist, you will familiarize other team members with our models to the extent and level of detail necessary for them. Requirements 3+ years experience modeling large, complex data sets. Comprehensive understanding of graph theory, network analysis, NLP, and other areas of statistical data analysis. Advanced coding skills in Python, familiarity with docker and AWS. Ability to prototype rapidly and also ship maintainable, production-ready code. Excellent communication skills, ability to explain complex facts to diverse audiences. Curiosity when doing research, diligence when developing software. You communicate clearly and you use precise language. You can communicate concepts at different levels of complexity. I.e. you can change your explanation depending on the audience. You think of what information the person you are talking to needs and you frame it in the context useful to them, not the one that is easiest for you to use. Great to have You are familiar with the body of research on community search algorithms. You are familiar with systems thinking and systems design principles. You have an interest in sociology, anthropology, evolutionary psychology or related fields. You are interested in and deeply familiar with some online cultures, memes etc. You are a heavy user of some social media platforms and/or a member of some online communities. You are interested in and familiar with game theory. Benefits Work setup We are a remote-first team. Most of the team is based in Europe. We try to meet in person and work together for several days every :4 months. Other than that the company \xe2\x80\x98lives\xe2\x80\x99 in Slack, Notion, Linear, Vowel and other tools enabling effective communication. If you work from Berlin, you can work from our Berlin office, located in Mitte. How To Apply We don\'t care about what you did before or what acronyms you can put in front of your name. The only thing that really matters is whether you can solve problems. That\'s the reason the process for this role is different from what you may have encountered before. Step 1: Please click the apply button. In the confirmation email, you will get a link to a Typeform with some task-related questions. These questions are intentionally hard. We know that you can\'t fully solve the problems presented in the form \xe2\x80\x93 the goal is to see how you approach solving them. We want to see how you think. Step 2: 1st phone interview Step 3 : Take home task, 2-4 hours. Step 4 : Final phone interview. Step 5: Paid trial project. We will ask you to work on a specific project along with our team. The idea here is for both for us and for you to experience what it is like to work with each other. Step 6: We make you an offer. Mehr anzeigen Weniger anzeigen",21

Your profile & skills You have extensive experience working with Java and/or React Used to work in an agile environment using scrum. You want to change the healthcare system by using your passion for tech. You like the idea of working in a rapidly growing startup environment. You have direct experience OR a firm understanding of how working with consumer-facing products can differ from other industries Curiosity and a highly collaborative work style, a wish to share what you already know and jumping at the opportunity to dive into new technology and territory. Previous experience working with development tools and concepts such as Git and continuous integration/delivery. You are continuously learning new technology and frameworks, and keeping up to date with new technology and best practices. What\xe2\x80\x99s in it for you? Amazing, friendly, smart colleagues from all over the world. The opportunity to grow and learn from knowledgeable co-workers and cross-collaboration across departments.
