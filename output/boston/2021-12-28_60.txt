Data EngineerThe Data Engineer will play a pivotal role in operationalizing the most-urgent data and analytics initiatives. The bulk of the data engineerâ€™s work would be building, managing, and optimizing data pipelines and then moving these data pipelines effectively into production for key data and analytics consumers. Data engineer will also need to guarantee compliance with data governance and data security requirements while creating, improving and operationalizing these integrated and reusable data pipelines.Serve as a key contributor to identify, evaluate, and execute the development and implementation of data infrastructurePerform analysis on large datasets to make and implement recommendations for maximizing customer experienceAssist in the design and implementation of relational databases and structures as neededWorks collaboratively with Application development teams throughout the product development process, to ensure optimal usage of SQL Server for storage and transaction processingBuild data pipelines with Microsoft SQL Server Business Intelligence stack including relational databases, data cubes (tabular/multidimensional), SQL Reporting, Power BI, and other tools as needed. Managed data pipelines consist of a series of stages through which data flows. These data pipelines must be created, maintained, and optimized as workloads move from development to production for specific use cases. Architecting, creating, and maintaining data pipelines will be the primary responsibility of the data engineer.Write, refine, and optimize T-SQL code for maximum performance, reliability, and maintainabilityParticipate in developing cutting-edge storage design structures and data processing flowsDrive automation through effective metadata management: The data engineer will be responsible for using innovative and modern tools, techniques, and architectures to partially or completely automate the most common, repeatable, and tedious data preparation and integration tasks to minimize manual and error-prone processes and improve productivity. The data engineer will also need to assist with renovating the data management infrastructure to drive automation in data integration and management QualificationsBachelor's degree in Computer science, statistics, applied mathematics, data management, information systems, information science, or a related quantitative field or equivalent work experience is required. 5+ years of experience developing SQL/T-SQL including, Single-row and Multi-row functions, complex joins, Common Table Expressions (CTEs), Procedures, Packages, ETL jobs, and Data linages in ADFStrong ability to design, build and manage data pipelines for data structures encompassing data transformation, data models, schemas, metadata, and workload management. The ability to work with both IT and business in integrating analytics and data science output into business processes and workflowsStrong experience with popular database programming languages including SQL for relational databases and knowledge of upcoming NoSQL/Hadoop oriented databases like MongoDB, Cosmos DB, others for nonrelational databasesStrong experience in working with large, heterogeneous datasets in building and optimizing data pipelines, pipeline architectures, and integrated datasets using traditional data integration technologies. These should include ETL/ELT, data replication/CDC, message-oriented data movement, and API designStrong experience in working with and optimizing existing ETL processes and data integration and data preparation flows and helping to move them in production.Experience working with popular data discovery, analytics, and BI software tools like Power BI, Tableau, Alteryx, and othersExperience with the Microsoft SQL Server Business Intelligence stack (SSAS, SSIS, SSRS), and Excel/Power QueryExperience with agile and lean development methodologies (SCRUM/Lean)Knowledge and experience with cloud data management and analytics with Microsoft Azure or Amazon AWS are strongly preferred
